try dsa <br>
fail at dsa <br>
correct the wrongs at dsa solutions <br>
and repeat this a lot of times.<br>

I am struggling to make habits in programming, like i made for typing for about a month, i want to give all of myself to learning a certain technology top to botttom, i feel like i get overwhelmed to encompass all of it and do it. <br>
<br>
I will make it happen! I feel like i am very close to doing it, thank you god for this opportunity!
