problem solving is about one thing and one thing only, 
that is keep asking questions! 
some may be bad, some may be good 
until you ask the right question that gets the job done!

If you **build** , you will face problems,
and then you have to **problem-solve** or 
think what is the most **useful** way to do the job (here by keep asking questions - good and bad - until you ask the right question that breaks the problem and makes it a joy to the work for it )
if you encounter this event enought times in life, 
you will either **memorize** unconsciously or by will.

try to build something useful everyday
try to ask questions everyday about the world
try to memorize something everyday
try to problem solve for yourself or somebody else everyday
try to find something useful everyday

try to be helpful everyday for you or others
try to be kind everyday!
