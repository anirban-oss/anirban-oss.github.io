journal in one line<br>
<br>
i intend to showcase my computer science daily journals here for myself, <br>
for practice and to be able to access the previous works from anywhere that i want in the world,  <br>
i dont need to go through github directories every time, i just want it like a cool website. <br>
<br>
EGO IS THE ENEMY<br>
<br>
ASPIRE TO BE EQUAL TO YOUR SENIORS BY HARD WORK<br>
ASPIRE TO BE EQUAL TO YOUR JUNIORS BY HELPING THEM AND GIVING THEN OPPORTUNITIES<br>
<br>
SHARE SUCCESS WITH OTHERS<br>
TAKE JOY IN THE SUCCESS OF SOMEBODY ELSE<br>
<br>
TEACH ABOUT YOUR FAILURES TO OTHERS<br>
LEARN FROM THE FAILURE OF OTHERS<br>
<br>
when you see yourself not thinking in this manner, know that your ego is speaking, when you want to be better than everyone else, when your failures are caused by no fault of your own but others, when you think that nobody else can replicate your success or that you are invincible.
