ego is the enemy! <br>
<br>
    &emsp;ego shows up in aspiring to be better than anybody else, not equal to them <br>
    &emsp;ego shows up when we think all the successes in our life comes only from our efforts, none from others <br>
    &emsp;ego shows up while blaming others for our own failures and taking no responsibility of it <br>
